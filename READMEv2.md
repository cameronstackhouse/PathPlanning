# Path Planning on the Edge
In this project, we aim to develop two new algorithms designed for dynamic path planning on single-board computers.

The two new algorithms are:

    - MB-SRRT-Edge
    - AD* Lite

##Â Running instructions
Clone the PathPlanning repository into the src folder () TODO LINK.


## Methods

This code contains the implementations of two new algorithms designed for dynamic path planning on single board computers.
